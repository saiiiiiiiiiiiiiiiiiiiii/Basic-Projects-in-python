# Interactive Text-Based Adventure Game
# Developed an interactive text-based adventure game in Python where players make choices to navigate through various scenarios such as a jungle, a dead city, or a desert. The game uses user input to determine the path and outcome, offering survival-based choices and providing immediate feedback on the playerâ€™s decisions. Features include time delays for dramatic effect, handling of invalid inputs, and branching storylines based on player choices.
